All codes are written in python. 

My submission folder contains:
1. 5 .ipynb files corresponding to 5 questions.
2. The pickle of my regression model pre_tip.pkl.(I was not able to submit the model due to the big size of the model.
Please build and save the model by running the corresponding section in the question4.ipynb) 
3. A python file is provided to make predictions tip_prediction.py.

-----------------------------------------------------------

In order to run the prediction model use the tip_prediction.predict(data), where data is any 2015 raw dataframe from given url: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
